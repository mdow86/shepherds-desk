Task: Plan a short Christian video from user input for Church/school audiences. Produce 6–10 clips with clean, family-safe content.

Clip count:
- If CLIP_COUNT is provided as a positive integer, produce exactly that many clips.
- Otherwise produce 6–8 clips.

Schema:
{
  "title": "string",
  "target_length_sec": number,
  "clips": [
    {
      "index": number,
      "start_sec": number,
      "end_sec": number,
      "mode": "dialogue" | "verse" | "both",
      "dialogue_text": "string | null",
      "verse": { "ref": "Book ch:vs", "text": "string" } | null,
      "image_prompt": "string",
      "video_motion_prompt": "string | null",
      "subtitle": "string"
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- start_sec/end_sec strictly increasing. end_sec > start_sec.
- Aim for ~6–10s spoken content per clip. If mode is "verse" or "both", include verse.text.
- Tone: biblical, pastoral, child-friendly. Avoid graphic depictions; paraphrase dark passages to a non-violent, non-graphic summary.
- image_prompt: describe the concrete scene only (time period, time of day, buildings, clothing, people count and placement, animals, environment, lighting, composition). NO style/brand words. NO text/typography/watermarks/logos. 16:9 framing implied. (Renderers apply visual style presets.)
- video_motion_prompt: short camera/action directive (e.g., "slow push-in; soft breeze moving fabric"). Describe what moves and how. No dialogue or lyrics.
- subtitle: ≤100 chars, non-empty, faithful to the spoken content.
- Output pure JSON.

Safety:
- Forbid: nudity, suggestive content, gore, blood, weapons, torture, occult themes, horror.
- Keep attire modest. No romantic intimacy. No graphic violence.
- Use KJV/ESV/NIV-like phrasing for verse.ref; dialogue_text should be paraphrased and TTS-friendly.

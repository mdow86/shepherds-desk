Task: Plan a short Christian video from user input for Church/school audiences. Produce 6–10 clips with clean, family-safe content.

Clip count:
- If CLIP_COUNT is provided as a positive integer, produce exactly that many clips.
- Otherwise produce 6–8 clips.
- If the narration cannot fit the per-clip word limits, split into more clips even if the user specified a fixed count.

Schema:
{
  "title": "string",
  "target_length_sec": number,
  "clips": [
    {
      "index": number,
      "start_sec": number,
      "end_sec": number,
      "mode": "dialogue" | "verse" | "both",
      "dialogue_text": "string | null",
      "verse": { "ref": "Book ch:vs", "text": "string" } | null,
      "image_prompt": "string",
      "video_motion_prompt": "string | null",
      "subtitle": "string"
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- Treat dialogue_text as NARRATION (voiceover). No character lip-sync.
- Per-clip length: exactly 5.0 seconds by default. Set end_sec = start_sec + 5.
- Narration words per clip MUST be 6–12 inclusive. Keep language plain, rhythmic, and memorable.
- start_sec/end_sec strictly increasing. No overlaps. end_sec > start_sec.
- If mode is "verse" or "both", include verse.text. If the verse is long, split it across multiple 5s clips and keep each narration segment 6–12 words.
- Tone: biblical, pastoral, child-friendly. Avoid graphic depictions; paraphrase dark passages non-violently.
- Subtitles: ≤100 chars, faithful to the narration, title-style or sentence-style is fine.

IMAGE PROMPT QUALITY (write for image generators):
- Describe the concrete scene in 1–2 tight sentences. No brand/style words. No text/typography/watermarks/logos. 16:9 framing implied.
- Be specific and grounded:
  • SUBJECTS: exact count, age range, modest attire, posture, facial expressions, skin tones described neutrally.
  • SETTING & ERA: architecture/materials accurate to context; indoor/outdoor; terrain; vegetation; relevant props.
  • LIGHTING: time of day, weather, light direction/quality (e.g., warm backlight, soft overcast), color temperature.
  • CAMERA & COMPOSITION: shot size (wide/medium/close), perspective, depth of field, foreground/midground/background elements, left/right/center placement.
  • TEXTURES: stone/wood/fabric, reflections, shadows/highlights.
- Example style (do NOT copy words, follow structure):
  “A crowded city sidewalk at noon; five teens of mixed backgrounds in modest clothing walk toward camera, eyes fixed on phones; storefronts and bus stop behind; hard sunlight from right casting short shadows; medium-wide shot, eye level, shallow depth with soft bokeh.”

VIDEO MOTION PROMPT QUALITY (write for image-to-video models, 5s single shot):
- Present tense. One continuous shot. Start→middle→end in one sentence or two.
- Include camera path and subject/environment motion with spatial anchors.
  • Camera: slow push-in/out, gentle pan/tilt, low dolly; say direction and speed.
  • Subjects: who moves, how far, relative to frame edges or landmarks.
  • Environment: leaves/breeze, light rays, people crossing background, screens flickering, etc.
- No dialogue or on-screen text.
- Example pattern:
  “Slow push-in from center as the anchor glances down at a phone on desk, then looks up; ticker screens flicker softly in background; end on a steady close framing.”

Safety:
- Forbid: nudity, suggestive content, gore, blood, weapons, torture, occult themes, horror.
- Keep attire modest. No romantic intimacy. No graphic violence.
- Use KJV/ESV/NIV-like phrasing for verse.ref; narration should be paraphrased and TTS-friendly.

Output shaping:
- Favor short, punchy narration like broadcast or trailer lines.
- If a concept needs more visual coverage, split into multiple 5s clips with varied camera/framing.
- Avoid generic image_prompt like “Jesus with disciples.” Always specify count, setting cues, lighting, and composition.
